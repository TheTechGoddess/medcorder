                <p class="remember">Why record?</p>
                <p class="win-win align">Patients remember only about 10% of the content of their doctor’s appointment by the next day, and doctors speak at about 130 words per minute.</p>
                <p class="makes align">Doctor conversations can be stressful and overwhelming, especially during a serious medical situation, making it difficult to accurately remember everything discussed. Having a recording of what the doctor said can help patients better retain important information, gain a better understanding of options, and make the best decisions possible.

        <div class="cartoon1">
            <div class="left">
                <p class="remember">Is recording OK?</p>
                <p class="win-win align">Yes. As a patient, you are allowed to record - with doctor permission - and share your own medical conversations as you see fit.</p>
                <p class="makes align">Asking to record a conversation is within your rights as a patient. We've found that asking permission works best when patients share the reason why they are recording (for example, to share with family not in the room) and the hoped-for outcome (better remembering what the doctor said). In some cases, a doctor may be more comfortable just recording a summary of the discussion at the end. If your doctor has questions, you can point them to more information For Providers.
